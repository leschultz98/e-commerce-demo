## Intro

Create a seller profile page for an e-commerce website that displays basic
info about the seller and a list of what they sell.

## Requirement:

- Create a simple react web app with one single page: a seller profile page with basic
  aesthetic styling
- Implement a way to authenticate user to know whether the current user is a visitor (not
  logged-in user), a buyer (logged-in user but does not own the profile), and the owner (a
  seller who owns this profile page)
- For visitor, show a list of products without any button
- For buyer, show a list of products with button to add/remove the product to their cart (you
  donâ€™t need to implement the cart, just need to store the product in an array and print out
  in the console that the product has been added/removed from the cart)
- For owner, has a way for them to edit their profile page and add/remove their products
- Seller profile info has name, phone number, description
- Each product has name, description, and price

## Bonus point:

Implement a way for the owner to edit the order of their products displayed on the page.

For example if the current profile page show:

Product_1

Product_2

Product_3

And the owner wants to change the order to:

Product_2

Product_3

Product_1
